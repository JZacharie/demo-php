# Run Oro Application Demo in Docker

## Prerequisites

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

**Note:** The application uses port 80, so make sure that other services do not use it.

## Run Application

#### 1. Download Repository With Docker Compose Configuration File

Check out the git repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oroinc/docker-demo.git
cd docker-demo
```
Or download the archive file and extract it:
```bash
wget https://github.com/oroinc/docker-demo/archive/master.tar.gz -O - | tar -xzf -
cd docker-demo
```

#### 2. Run Application Containers

The configuration is entirely predefined, and you can only change the domain name where the application will be located. By default, it is `oro.demo`. If you need to change the domain, edit the `.env` file and change `ORO_APP_DOMAIN=my-custom-domain.demo`.

Run init service:
```bash
docker compose up restore
```

Alternatively, you can install the application from scratch, but it will require more time and resources.

Run install service:
```bash
docker compose up install
```

You can run the application as soon as it is installed or initialized.

Run application:
```bash
docker compose up application
```

The docker compose will download the required images, create networks and run containers.
Application [orocommerce-application](https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-application) is used by default.
You can run other community applications, such as `crm-application`, `platform-application`, or `commerce-crm-application`.
To select another application, set another image in the `.env` file, for example:
```bash
ORO_IMAGE=docker.io/oroinc/crm-application
```
If you want to get the application in a different locale, add the contents of the file `.env-locale-de_DE` or `.env-locale-fr_FR` to `.env` and restart the restore service and application.
```bash
cat .env-locale-de_DE >> .env
```

To track the logs from the php-fpm-app container, run `docker compose logs -f php-fpm-app`. To get the list of containers, run `docker compose ps`.

#### 3. Add a Record to File `/etc/hosts`

```
127.0.0.1 oro.demo
```

#### 4. Open the Application in a Browser

Now, you can open URL [http://oro.demo](http://oro.demo) in your browser.

To access the back-office, use *admin* as both login and password.
To access the storefront, use the credentials of the predefined demo user roles. To log in as a buyer, use *BrandaJSanborn@example.org* both as your login and password. To log in as a manager, use *AmandaRCole@example.org* both as your login and password.

## Access the Mail Catcher

[Smtp service](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) is additionally launched so that you can send emails from the application. It receives all mail and has a web interface that enables you to view it and perform the required actions. The web interface for the mail catcher is available at the address [http://oro.demo/mailcatcher](http://oro.demo/mailcatcher).

## Stop the Application

- To stop and remove all containers, run `docker compose down`.

- To stop and remove all containers with the data saved in volumes, run `docker compose down -v`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you deployed the application before, pull fresh images with `docker compose pull`.

## About this Project

This repository provides a Docker Compose configuration file (compose.yaml) and demonstrates how to run different applications + required services in containers. Oro Inc. provides images with applications Community Edition in public Docker Hub.

**This deployment is NOT intended for a production environment.**

**Docker images with different applications:**
OroCommerce Community Edition: [docker.io/oroinc/orocommerce-application](https://hub.docker.com/r/oroinc/orocommerce-application)
OroCRM Community Edition: [docker.io/oroinc/crm-application](https://hub.docker.com/r/oroinc/crm-application)
OroPlatform Community Edition: [docker.io/oroinc/platform-application](https://hub.docker.com/r/oroinc/platform-application)

One image is used to run containers in several roles: web server, php-fpm, consumer, websocket server, and cron service.
All these services must be running, and the PostgreSQL database must be prepared for a full-fledged application.
